# Banner Launcher

Banner Launcher is an games launcher written with GTK+3 which uses Steam
banner/header images. They are 460x215 sized images which are used in the
grid view of the Steam Client. Banner Launcher can be used to launch any
application.

### UI

- Context Menus for Entries
- Steam Import Window
- Add/Edit Entry Window
- Settings Window
- Icons/hints for problems in games (missing image?)
- Input Works on main window as I desire:
  - Typing always edits the filter box and filters games
  - Arrow keys go from filter/search box down into Entries
  - Enter Runs Game
  - Scrolling scrolls the entries
  - Escape Closes Launcher

### Functionality

- Filtering
- Config file
- Launch Game Functionality
    - cd
    - Steam launch by id
- Optionally Update Steam every run?
